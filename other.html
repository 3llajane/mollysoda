<p>Visual artist Molly Soda presents a live performance on the Rhizome Discord channel. Following the performance, she will be accompanied by Briana Griffin, Community Designer, and Kayla Drzewicki, Program Assistant, for a brief Q&A session.
    This event forms part of Rhizome's Office Hours, a series of casual online discussions exploring their work and the broader realm of digital art. These conversations are facilitated by Briana Griffin, Community Designer at Rhizome. 
    Molly Soda is known for her work spanning video, installation, interactive art, performance, and print media. Much of her work is hosted online, particularly on social media platforms, fostering an evolving interaction with these digital spaces. Soda's artistic inquiry often delves into themes such as the revisitation of one's virtual legacy, the performance of self in online environments, and the dynamic nature of digital spaces and its impact on memory and self-concept.</p>

    <p>Livestreaming, a multibillion-dollar industry largely controlled by Big Tech, often leaves streamers with little control over platform dynamics. "Is this THING on?" emerges as a bespoke livestreaming platform for artists, doubling as a software development experiment and performance art.

        During our time at the C/Change R&D lab, we pondered the essence of creating and sustaining a decentralized network like THING.
        
        Our approach involved progressive decentralization across seasons, shaped by performances and public forums.
        
        THING is a collaborative project led by Molly Soda, Christopher Clary, soft networks, Sarah Rothberg, Semi Anonymous Friend, and potentially you? </p>
